        <h2>The rules</h2>
        <p>
          Hockey is a high-speed, team-based sport played on ice, where players
          aim to score goals by hitting a puck into the opposing team’s net
          using a stick. The game emphasizes skill, strategy, and physical play,
          and it’s governed by structured rules to keep play fair and safe. Each
          match consists of three periods, and players must follow specific
          guidelines regarding movement, scoring, and conduct.
        </p>
        <li>
          Game Structure: 3 periods of 20 minutes each, with intermissions
          between periods.
        </li>
        <li>
          Team Composition: 6 players per side on the ice at a time — 5 skaters
          and 1 goalie.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scoring: A goal is scored when the puck fully crosses the goal line
          between the goalposts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Offside: Players must not enter the offensive zone before the puck
          does.
        </li>
        <li>
          Icing: Shooting the puck across both the center line and the
          opponent’s goal line without it being touched results in a stoppage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Face-offs: Used to resume play after a stoppage; players line up and
          battle for puck control.
        </li>
        <li>
          Penalties: Infractions like tripping, high-sticking, or roughing
          result in time in the penalty box (usually 2 minutes), leaving the
          team short-handed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Power Plays: When one team has more players on the ice due to an
          opponent’s penalty.
        </li>
